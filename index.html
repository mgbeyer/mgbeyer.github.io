								Hi, my name is Michael G. Beyer 
								</h2>
								<p>
								I am a software engineer by profession, photographer by obsession and disorganized person by confession.
								<br/><br/>
								I have a broad range of interests which led to various and quite different kinds of online activities and projects over the last couple years. Widespread and also kind of chaotic and confusingly distributed projects. 
								<br/><br/>
								Therefore I needed a place, a focal point, to provide interested parties with an overview and a stepping stone. Jobwise but also very personally, related to my hobbies and other topics I'm interested in.
								<br/><br/>
								<strong>So, come on in, be informed, have fun!</strong>

								<h2>Professional showcase</h2>
								<p>
								I started my career as a self-educated web designer and backend coder in the late 90s and I have worked on many software engineering projects ever since. Altogether I look back at well over 14 years of work as a software developer, intermitted by periods of study. I hold a diploma in applied information science from the university of applied sciences in Hannover, Germany (the focus is software engineering). I also hold a Master's degree in computer science from the RWTH university in Aachen, Germany (with a focus on research).

								<h2>Personal playground</h2>
								<p>
								I love photography! At any suitable opportunity I take literally hundreds of pictures - more than I ever can manage to assort, edit and publish on one of my related website projects. I also dabble in different fields of art, more or less frequently. Once in a while I like to do a little photoshopping or a little "analog" painting with acrylic paint on photo prints. Another field of interest is sequencer based electronic music (but to hone such a skill takes time I don't really have, so everything got stuck in its infancy).

								<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
								<p class="lefty">
								<span class="image left"><img src="images/mgb.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<strong>Typical 80s computer kid?</strong>
								I was born in a small town in Northern Hesse, Germany. Since I was a kid I'm interested in computers and science. At the age of 9 I got my first personal computer, a (legendary) Commodore 64 <a class="nblink" class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7ZA4gNtqnk"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>, and soon started to learn my first computer languages (Basic, then not much later Assembler). So I guess in the end it was only natural I went the path I went and many years later started to work in the field, study in the field, even focused some of my private activities in the field. 
								<br/>
								But even though I really love doing all this very much, and in some aspects I even might be considered a "nerd" or "geek", the whole "computer thing" does not define me. To say it in the words of the famous british comedy trope "Monty Python": And now for something completely different... <a class="nblink" class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0WOIwlXE9g"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>
								</p>
								<h3>L'art pour l'art</h3>
								<p class="lefty">
								What really defines me in terms of a deep fascination is this: Art. The act of playful creation for the sake of it. I don't even care if things I do are "good", "worthy" or even "sane" in the "eyes of the beholder". What I really care for is the mere feeling things I create can give me. So now you might have an idea what floats my goat :) <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="http://images.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=float+goat"><img class="icn" src="images/image.png"/></a>

									<h3>The strangely wonderful world of the 70s pop culture aesthetics</h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									See, I'm a movie junkie right from the cradle. And in particular I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and horror movies, especially from the 1970s. I like the special aesthetic of dystopien flicks like "THX 1138" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6Z2ag8FMZw"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>, "Logan's Run" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1URzQ9tHmU"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>, "Phase IV" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beLpsWaUDNk"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>, "Soylent Green" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOV8mBjHHYg"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>, "The Omega Man" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZWy7q3AXy0"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a> or "Westworld" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jCDQvNh85Y"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a> to name but a few. Those movies and many many more of this particular era, as well as the aesthetics, architecture, general style and play of colors of this decade altogether, had a huge impact on my personal taste in and preferences of "design" and "ambience" in general.
									<br/>
									Oh and of course they had a huge impact on today's pop culture as well. Just look at this clip from "the Simpsons", it's outright hilarious :-) <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWh1neO2_4U"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-palette">
									<h3>From movie junkie to art fan in a heartbeat</h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									Then, when I still was a kid, I saw Ridley Scott's "Alien" for the first time <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6mvwOCYJjc"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a> and this very moment really got to me. Like a seed planted within me my fascination for the whole genre began to grow in the years to come. All this was accompanied by a strong attraction to the dark and creepy but also strangely beautiful kind of atmosphere, this movie conveyed.
									<br/>
									And I realized there was an actual artist behind this movie, not the usual bunch of set designers. A real artist who had created the scenery which transposed this strange form of beauty to the viewer. And I'm a huge admirer of H. R. Giger in particular ever since <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4Zzag7MusM"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>, as well as art in general. This cineastic experience was my "rite of pasasage" to art and the surreal.
									<br/>
									Meanwhile the whole Alien franchise is deeply ingrained in pop culture (e.g. Mel Brook's movie "Spaceballs" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-sBROXalU4"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"/></a>).
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-biohazard">
									<h3>Progressive rock zombies</h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									Then there were all those 70s and 80s italian zombie flicks <small>(*)</small>, later discovered (and refined) by George A. Romero whom in turn I discovered, when I first saw "Dawn of the Dead" back then. And it was the Argento EURO cut I saw, with the hypnotic and ambient progressive rock score from "Goblin" which transfixed me from the very start <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2yGLTsnisc"><img class="icn" src="images/note.png"></a> and then altered and refined my taste in music, too (which later transcended (besides other musical genres) into a full-fledged faible for electronic sounds <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBzsiQTJbhA"><img class="icn" src="images/note.png"></a>, psychedelic <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHEmELDPMog"><img class="icn" src="images/note.png"></a> and Krautrock <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6diHhKSDyE"><img class="icn" src="images/note.png"></a>).
									</p>
									<p class="lefty smltxt">
									(*) A LITTLE SIDE NOTE: 
									<br/>
									This was WAY before the big zombie hype of the present time. Way before TWD and high quality special effects even on TV. And zombies were off pop culture, people watching stuff like this considered at least a little "weird". All-in-all it were the "garage days of zombie culture" :)
									<br/><br/>
									Oh and just for good measure, here's the most likeable zombie EVER, Bub from George A. Romero's "Day of the Dead" <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBX7orUiIxU"><img class="icn" src="images/video.png"></a>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-map-signs">
									<h3>The "professional" path I went</h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									Yes, "professional" in quotation marks for a reason. I guess for the typical IT recruiter or HR person working for a company, the ideal structure or timeline of a (academic) resume goes something like this:
									</p>
									<p class="lefty">
									<strong>The streamlined approach to working.</strong> <br/>
									Born, went to school, holds relevant degrees (bachelor, master), if there's a couple years of real field experience that's even better. Oh and the only gap in the resume is the space between characters and lines, the only variance between all those resumes lies in the names and adresses of the applicants!
									</p>
									<p class="lefty">
									<strong>My timeline is a bit different, though.</strong> <br/>
									Born, went to school, completed a vocational training in a boring job I didn't like much (why do it then? because "reality of life", that's why!), never really worked much in this job but worked rather this and that (had to pay bills after all), completed additional training in yet another job field I liked this time but actually never worked a single day in it (why? because the job was all about customer contact and I just didn't look presentable enough at this time), so worked this and that once again... bills, you know! <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IrQHeDcMi8"><img class="icn" src="images/note.png"></a>.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>Finally</h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									I started to work in a job I really liked and nobody cared if I didn't exactly dress like a yuppie: My first job as a software developer. So I quit my current job (which was a dull odd job anyway) and thought: "what the heck, give it a try". But I had no training, qualification or degree for that whatsoever.
									<br/>
									But it worked out a couple years. However after a job change I got really frustrated because I was still widely underpaid and highly underappreciated. And so I decided to go to university to earn a degree in computer science. After that I worked for many years on end in a couple more or less acceptable jobs as a software developer. But finally I saw absolutely no potential for future development whatsoever. When I looked back all I saw was a whole decade of my life wasted on temporary dead-end contracts in jobs that didn't promise any future career potential. So I spontaneously quit my last job and went back to university to try and get a master's degree (computer science and philosophy). Now I'm done and it still remains to be seen if this was the right decision. Who knows, maybe the next phase in my personal career development will be a PhD. If and when such an opportunity might arise in the near future, I'm quite sure I will take it...
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-anchor">
									<h3>My private path</h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									With many job changes it comes as no surprise that often there are many changes in residence as well. Born in a small town I went to a larger city some day (to study there), after that I went to an even larger city to work there, just because at the time I thought becoming a city slicker was a great idea. Fun fact: No it was not. Ok, I do admit, urban lifestyle has its merit. It certainly has 24-7 cocktail supply if you're into it (which I totally am). But its also overcrowded, stressed out, loud and you can't breathe. So gradually I moved away from the city, the older I got, the farther. At first in Cologne I just moved from downtown to the vicinity. Then I moved to a smaller city (which was a total bummer, screw you Düren! I hate your guts!). Then I moved to a small village in the middle of nowhere. And still: Too many people too close around me. So finally I moved to a place in Belgium which provides decent space, a house in the midst of cornfields and woods, the next neighors are deer and maybe those guys <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087050/mediaviewer/rm671670528"><img class="icn" src="images/image.png"></a>. 
									<br/><br/>
									So today I seek blissful solitude. A little cabin in the woods would be fine, calm and quiet. But then there's the commute. Its daily hell on four wheels already. A nice little daily 6 hour trip from a mountain lodge to the nearest city I'd manage to find a job in just wouldn't cut it.

									<h3>Jenny <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtHgUvtpqwc"><img class="icn" src="images/note.png"></a> </h3>
									<p class="lefty">
									Oh, when I say "I" in the last paragraph I mean "we" of course. And this "we" exists for many many wonderful years now. Cologne was not that bad after all, because it was here where I met my future wife Jenny! I know her for nearly 10 years now and we're happily married for over three years. She is the greatest and most important person in my life. I love her so much! And she bears a great responsibility and burden, too. She takes good care, that I won't go feral ;-) <a class="nblink" target="_blank" href="http://dilbert.com/strip/2011-06-26"><img class="icn" src="images/image.png"></a>
